1. on.push.<branches|branches-ignore>  (feature-1, feature-2, release04112025)
2. on.workflow_call.inputs 
3. on.workflow_dispatch.inputs
4. concurrency:
  	group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
 	cancel-in-progress: true
5. two jobs, needs, runs-on 
6. jobs.<job_id>.outputs (call output on second job)
7. run: echo "Workflow input is ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}" use like this
8. environment secret run: echo "Secret value is ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEYID }}"
