Hereâ€™s a complete GitHub Actions setup using two workflows:

reusable.yml: A reusable workflow using workflow_call that accepts inputs, sets an output, and prints secret/environment input values.

main.yml: A main workflow that:

Triggers on push, workflow_dispatch

Calls the reusable workflow with inputs

Uses concurrency, needs, and handles outputs from reusable workflow

.github/workflows/reusable.yml (Reusable Workflow)

name: Reusable Workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      environment:
        required: true
        type: string
      run_tests:
        required: false
        type: boolean
        default: true

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      result: ${{ steps.set_output.outputs.result }}
    steps:
      - name: Show input
        run: echo "Workflow input is ${{ inputs.environment }}"
        
      - name: Show secret
        run: echo "Secret value is ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEYID }}"

      - name: Set custom output (v1 style)
        id: set_output
        run: echo "result=success-from-reusable" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Set output (alternate v2 style)
        id: alt_output
        run: |
          RESULT_VAR="success-alt"
          echo "result_alt=${RESULT_VAR}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

.github/workflows/main.yml (Main Workflow)

name: Main Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - feature-1
      - feature-2
      - release04112025
    branches-ignore:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment'
        required: true
        default: dev
      run_tests:
        description: 'Run tests?'
        required: false
        default: true
        type: boolean

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  call-reusable:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable.yml
    with:
      environment: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment || 'dev' }}
      run_tests: ${{ github.event.inputs.run_tests || true }}
    secrets: inherit
    outputs:
      result: ${{ steps.set_output.outputs.result }}

  consume-output:
    needs: call-reusable
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Output from reusable
        run: echo "Reusable output was ${{ needs.call-reusable.outputs.result }}"


---

Highlights:

Triggers on push to specific branches and ignores others.

workflow_dispatch.inputs handled in main.yml.

workflow_call.inputs used in reusable.yml.

concurrency to cancel in-progress runs per ref.

Two jobs, with needs dependency and runs-on.

Secrets usage shown (secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEYID).

steps.set-output used in both v1 and v2 styles.


Let me know if you want to see this implemented with a real public repo example or CI/CD pattern!
